core.mainwindow.MainWindow.loadDiskFile:
    parse the file reader function return annotations with inspect.Signature
    
plugins.ltp.LTPWindow:
    slot_openBaselineRecords: delegates to openDataAcquisitionFiles (new function)
    
    new functions:
        openDataAcquisitionFiles: Opens electrophysiology data acquisition files.
        
    
neoutils:
    created ElectrophysiologyDataParser class -- to be completed
        purpose: encapsulate acquisition parameters and protocols for 
        electrophysiology data
        
        Intended to provide a common denominator for data acquired with various 
        electrophysiology software vendors. 
        
        Planned support: pClamp, CD Signal and Spike, Ephus, generic (i.e., 
        neo.Block, neo.Segment, and objects from neo signal family but without
        acquisition software-specific information).
        
        Will also implement detection/manual configuration of trigger events
        and trigger protocols (a.k.a stimulation/acquisition protocols).
